# incobalt's Core API
A Minecraft Forge library mod for use with other mods made by incobalt.

**incobalt's Core API** is yet another small library mod. It is designed to put common functions in one place for use with incobalt's other mods. Will change as new mods get built.

Included in Core API:
- An abstract base command class for registering aliases (very limited functionality here, mostly for having a base class)
- A server/client proxy for getting an appropriate PlayerEntity from a network packet context (humble thanks to Mine & Slash where I have shamelessly stolen the idea from)
- A utility for converting a String to an ITextComponent
 

As is the intention for all of incobalt's mods current or future, this mod is heavily commented to act as a learning resource.
